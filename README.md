## **Project Description: Spotify Wrapped Analysis in Power BI**  

### **Project Goals**  
The goal of this project was to create an **interactive Power BI report** that mimics Spotify Wrapped, providing insights into user streaming habits. By analyzing the **Spotify Streaming History dataset**, we aimed to uncover patterns in listening behavior, identify top artists and tracks, and measure engagement levels.  

### **Business Needs**  
Music streaming services, like Spotify, leverage **user listening data** to enhance customer experiences, recommend content, and drive engagement. This analysis helps answer key business questions:  
- What are the most played tracks and artists?
- How much time do users spend streaming music?
- Listening behavior per time of day (AM or PM)?
- Tracks with highest play count?
- What factors influence track starts and skips?
- How do listening habits change based on platform usage and shuffle mode?

By addressing these questions, businesses can **personalize recommendations**, optimize playlist curation, and improve user retention strategies.  

### **Discovering and Presenting Meaningful Insights**  
To extract valuable insights, we:  
1. **Cleansed and transformed** the dataset using **Power Query** to ensure accuracy.  
2. **Built measures and KPIs** in **DAX**, including **track play count, skipped rate, shuffle rate, and and number of tracks, artists, and album**.  
3. **Created a dynamic, 3-page Power BI report**:  
   - 🎵 **Listening Habits Overview** → Time-based analysis of listening trends, and user preferred streaming platform..  
   - ⏩ **Most Played** → Top tracks with play count and hours listened, top artists, top album.  
   - 📊 **Listening Behavior** → Skip rates, shuffle mode rate, shuffle/skip reason. and listening behavior.  

**Final Deliverable:** A sleek, interactive **Power BI dashboard** that helps users visualize and explore their Spotify listening habits in a data-driven way. 🚀🎶
